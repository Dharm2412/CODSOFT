## CODSOFT Virtual Internship - Java Programming

This repository contains the completed projects for the CODSOFT Virtual Internship in Java Programming. I successfully completed the four-week program and achieved the following learning objectives:

* **Fundamentals of Java programming:** variables, data types, operators, control flow statements, loops, methods, and classes.
* **Problem-solving and algorithm design:** applied these skills to complete the assigned projects with efficient and well-structured code.
* **Object-oriented programming:** utilized concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create reusable and maintainable code.

**Completed Projects:**

1. **Number Game:** Developed a Java program that generates a random number and allows the user to guess it within a limited number of attempts.
2. **ATMinterface:** A Java ATM program simulates an Automated Teller Machine, allowing users to perform basic operations like checking balance, withdrawing cash, and potentially making deposits
3. **Geade calculator:** A Java grade calculator program calculates letter grades based on user-provided scores, often using pre-defined grading scales.
4. **Quiz game:** A Java quiz game tests user knowledge by presenting questions, evaluating answers, and delivering feedback, often using loops and conditional statements for interactivity and scoring. It can involve various question formats like multiple choice, true/false, or open-ended based on the specific design.
